### A small program that is supposed to imitate Nixie Display.

### I won't be implementing tube graphics themselves cause it's just not worth it.
### It's pain to implement and does not look as good as expected (I know because i saw).

### The code itself is designed to be portable so it can be used as a library
> [!WARNING]
> ## ***It needs SDL2 and SDL2_ttf to work***

### The documentation is in the zip file generated by [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html).
### Just open index.html (I don't have resources to host it for now, Sorry!)
### You also have Doxyfile to generate docs if you want (I dunno why would you).

### As for building, cmake should work on every system but i can't check it.
```
$ cmake .
$ make
```
### So if it doesn't work you will have to mess with it (Sorry!).
